# EmployeeManagementSpringBootBackend        
### 
I built RESTful Web Services in the Microservices architecture using SpringBoot for the backend without fontend.    
I created endpoints related employee service(core service), housing service(core service), application service(core service) and onBoarding service(composite service) to simulate the new employee onboarding process.         
Employees will be able to update personal information, and monitor their housing situation through endpoints.
